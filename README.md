# Currency converter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## demo
https://mal-vka.github.io/currency_converter-react/

## description
This is a simple currency converter which allows you to calculate some common currencies with pre-declared rates.
It is made for educational purposes learning React, JS and further HTML&CSS training. 
To build this simple website, I used:
- was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app);
- ES6 features with immutability concept;
- the semantic HTML and the BEM methodology - for clear and structured references;
- cdn normalize and CSS (grid, basic transitions, media queries);
- OpenGraph tags.

## further development
Project will be evolving along with my programming skills. Probably, second version will be based on react framework.
Other ideas:
- add possibility of changing background-color with fancy switch button
- connection to API for downloading data on real exchange rates

## inspiration/source
The exercise scenario from the frontend course [YouCode](https://youcode.pl/) but is made by me.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
